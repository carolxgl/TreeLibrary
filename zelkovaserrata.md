The _zelkova_ is widely studied for its seed dispersal strategies. It is among the few species that have two types of seeds. Some seeds are dispersed as single seeds while other seeds are dispersed together with part of the shoot and some leaves that dry and allow for the seeds to be dragged away from the parent tree. 
THe flowers of the _zelkova_ appear between April and May, and the seeds ripen from September to November.
