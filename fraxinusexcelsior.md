_Fraxinus excelsior_ is known as the common ash, with a number of cultivars (types of ash grown in agricultural fields). The common ash is famous for its elastic timber used to make tennis raquets. Currently this species and its cultivars are being affected by a fungal disease known as the 'chalara ash dieback'.  This species flowers between April and May, and the seeds ripen between September and January.

The common ash is not only widely use for its timber, but also has multiple medicinal uses as diuretic, laxative among other.
