The evergreen _groene hulst_ is connected to many traditions that date back to the Druids, Celtics and Romans, that relate its evergreen properties during winter as a source of protection for the animals and the communities. And it is also one of the main symbols of Christmas in many countries around the world. It almost didn't make it to this list as it is a shrub but it is such a well-known species that we decided to inlude it.

The _groene hulst_ flowers from May to June, and the seeds ripen from November to March.
