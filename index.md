## Welcome to the Rengerpark tree library
The Rengerspark was open to the public in 1908, and was part of a land donated by mr. W.J. van Welderen baron Rengers, former mayor (1877-1883) of Leeuwarden and his wife, and layout according to the design proposed by H. Copijn. 

The inhabitants of the park are mostly trees, shrubs and birds, that coexist as a living library of trees from all over the world! We invite you to rediscover the park and learn more about its amazing secrets and TREEasures!
